# schedule_solver
Solving the scheduling problem with Genetic Algorithms and Google's OrTools

## TODO(zhach):
1) Complete GA implementation
2) Complete tests for it
3) Add test for or tools (it's freaking weird dude; no documentation at all)
4) Add data file

## Future work
1) Connecting input apps
    a) Like connecting to the tasks api or a kanban server to get tasks
2) Connect output apps
    a) Like connect to my calendar to make these time units for me
    b) Also try to track scheduled stuff in a db
3) Make a hueristic greedy scheduler
4) Make it run automatically
